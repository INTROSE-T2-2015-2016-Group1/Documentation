Advantages
1. Seamless Integration accross C# and the mySQL database.
2. C#'s object oriented capabilities leading to better data flow.
3. C# is a high level language which possesses a thick abstraction layer that would make the development more predictable in the testing process.
4. A popular languace like C# has an abundance of available libraries that can be used to speed up the development of the software.
5. C# had won as the "preferred language" on the debate within the group. Against other languages: Java and C.
6. C# is popular enough to have a good community support. i.e. help of solving problems using Stack Overflow.
7. A supposedly easy to learn language. For people coming from java background.

Disadvantages
1. Implementing a maintainable code in C# would be a challenge as Microsoft does not really impose a coding convention for it. Although an official programming guide from Microsoft will suffice.
2. Once compiled, the software is platform specific. It will only work on Windows machines.
3. Security is questionable. Because Microsoft products are notorious for secirity issues.
